// Seeding gives the engine's automatic group real measurements to choose from
// before it has to choose.
//
// A url-test group picks the lowest measured delay among the nodes that
// answered. Until it has measured, every node looks identical to it and
// mihomo's `fast()` returns the first proxy in the group — so a group handed
// eight hundred unmeasured nodes behaves exactly like the head-of-the-catalogue
// walk this was meant to replace, only inside the engine where it cannot be
// seen.
//
// And it stays that way for a while. The engine's own health check runs ten
// nodes at a time (`errgroup.SetLimit(10)` in the provider's healthcheck), so a
// first full round over eight hundred nodes is minutes, not seconds.
//
// So the app measures a sample itself, first, through the same engine and
// against the same URL the group tests with — which puts the results in the very
// history `fast()` reads. By the time the group is selected it has real numbers
// for a spread of the catalogue and picks the best of them.
