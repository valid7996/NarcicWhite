	// Windows has no such backstop — measured on a dual-stack machine, v4 goes
	// through the tunnel while v6 continues out of the physical adapter — so the

	IPv6 bool
	// Inet6Address gives the tunnel a v6 address so it can win the route. mihomo

	// which is why containment has to be verified after connecting and never

	// closes the DNS leak the desktop had in tunnel mode.
	//
	// dns-hijack is not enough on its own, because it can only catch what enters
	// the tunnel. A resolver on the local network does not: the route to
	// 192.168.0.0/16 is directly connected on the physical adapter and beats the
	// 0.0.0.0/1 pair the tunnel installs, so every query to the home router left
	// the machine in the clear. That is why the leak showed in tunnel mode and not
	// in proxy mode — through a proxy the machine never resolves anything itself,
	// it hands over the name and mihomo does the lookup.
	//
	// The phone has no equivalent setting and does not need one: VpnService takes
	// DNS servers directly (`addDnsServer`), so Android routes every query into
	// the tunnel itself. Windows offers nothing like that. So this is the second
	// place, after IPv6 containment, where matching the phone literally would mean
	// shipping a leak.
	//
	// What it costs: on Windows, WFP filters that block port 53 for everything
	// except the engine and the tunnel adapter. On Linux, unreachable policy rules
	// to the same end. macOS ignores it. The Windows filters live in a session
	// opened with FWPM_SESSION_FLAG_DYNAMIC, so they are removed when the engine
	// exits — including when it is killed, which matters: filters that outlived a
	// crash would leave a machine unable to resolve anything until it rebooted.
