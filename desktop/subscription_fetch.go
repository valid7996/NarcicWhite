// Fetching a subscription from a network that does not want you to.
//
// Networks that filter do not all fail the same way, and the difference decides
// what can fix it. Two failures were seen on the same subscription:
//
//	tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake
//
// means the bytes coming back are not TLS at all — something answered in place
// of the server. Verification never runs, so skipping it changes nothing. What
// helps there is the tunnel: once connected the app already has a path out of
// that network, and the subscription can be fetched through it.
//
// A certificate that does not verify is the other failure, and it is the
// opposite case. Something is terminating TLS and presenting its own
// certificate. Skipping verification does get the document — the same
// subscription that failed this way on iOS came through the moment that app's
// "fetch without checking the certificate" switch was turned on.
//
// So both exist here, and neither is offered where it cannot work. The switch is
// off by default and per-subscription: turning it on hands the account key in
// the URL to whoever is intercepting, which is a real cost and only the person
// who knows the provider and the network can weigh it.
