//
// It did. Spawn used exec.CommandContext, so the core was killed the moment
// that context was cancelled — which `defer cancel()` does the instant the
// connect function returns. Every proxy-mode connection died about a second
// after reporting success, while TUN was untouched because its core is started
// through ShellExecuteExW, which no context can reach.
//
// This test connects under a context, cancels it, and then asks the connection
// to carry a request. Under the old behaviour the engine is gone by then.
