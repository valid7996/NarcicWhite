// Refreshing what the network was blocking, once there is a way past it.
//
// A subscription whose address is blocked locally can only be fetched through
// the tunnel, which means connecting first and refreshing second. That order is
// not discoverable: the only place it is written down is the error you get for
// doing it the other way round, and the same user hit it twice — once before the
// message said so and once after. An instruction people have to read and then
// remember to act on is a step the app can take itself.
//
// So a successful connection retries the subscriptions that have nothing in
// them. Only those: a subscription that already imported nodes is not waiting on
// anything, and refreshing every one on every connect would put a burst of
// requests on the provider each time somebody reconnects.
