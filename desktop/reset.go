// Putting the app back to how it was on the day it was installed.
//
// This exists because nobody could get back there. A bug that only shows on a
// first launch — the catalogue missing from the subscriptions list, which is
// exactly what prompted this — is invisible to everyone who has used the app
// once, and that included every one of us. It took a user on a clean macOS
// install to find it, and confirming it on Windows meant writing a test rather
// than looking, because there was no way to make a Windows install fresh again
// short of deleting a folder by hand.
//
// A tool that can only be checked on hardware nobody has spare is a tool whose
// first-run experience never gets checked.
